damn this pc, its nice, it feels nice but i have to clear and organise a LOT like literally ALOT!
 It has got some really good features no doubt but i'm still looking forward to clean the mess of tons of accounts i made idk when.
also also twitter is a BIG BIG distraction, i just feel like disabling it all the time but end up not doing that.
Tbh any social site isn't good enough for me, known the fact it's all boring and not productive at ALL.
