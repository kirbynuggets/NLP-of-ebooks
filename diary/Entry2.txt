I wasted a lot of time today. Um i did have time since 9am, i um had breakfast then i went online, a little talk. 
Then i logged in to ig, honestly, i want a break from all of the social media stuffs, i am honestly done. 
Just feel like shutting down everything and leading a peaceful life with my brain active for the things that 
really matter and are important to me.
Ngl, I watched the bucky C++ videos today and though just watched only 2 of 'em i atleast understood them. 
It was actually interesting as in i would def want to watch more of the videos.
plus plus i talked to vartika today, um it was umm okay, not soo good tbh because i found it a bit irritating ngl
but aight. I have an hour and I am feeling sleepy now which i shouldn't be.
Also, ngl social media is just a platform to pass time and i wouldn't really want to
