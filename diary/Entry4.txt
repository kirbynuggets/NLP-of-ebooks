Day 1 of induction at zoom of IIIT G

Today was a fine day, a balance of emotions: excitement, cringe?, etc etc. people were too different, 
had different accents, personalities which i could j figure.

i personally liked the address by the director except some of the times i don't know maybe wasn't able to catchup 
to the emotion he wanted to convey, otherwise overall it was a good one.

Personally liked what he said about sincerity and honesty. i wouldn;t take school work to be a burden and shouldn't.

The professors too, they all were quite normal and the air was light.
The interaction with seniors wasn't the best honestly but they did seem pretty helping if anyone wanted to ask for one.

Ngl it felt like my school's teacher's day vala zoom mewting. bchhe were also okay only as i didn't interact much.
